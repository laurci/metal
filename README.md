Software-defined custom hardware accelerators and SOC for embedded systems

## Setup

Currently we only support the `Xillinx X7` series FPGA. We recommend to use an FPGA board like the `Arty A7` (either one of 35T or 100T will work). 

**Prerequisites:**

- `f4pga` for `xc7`
- The GNU RiscV toolchain
- `sbt`

**Setup:**

- `source ./core/arty/init.sh`
